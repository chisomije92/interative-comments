## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS Modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/) - For styles


### What I learned
This project aided me in gaining practice with the the use of the React library. Most particularly, it gave me an opportunity to solidify my knowledge on React context API, Custom Hooks and useReducer Hook. 



### Continued development
I aim to delve further and acquire more knowledge and practice with use of NextJs framework and Typescript.
